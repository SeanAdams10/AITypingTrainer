When the user hits the button on the main menu titled "show progress over time" - we need to bring up a new screen that shows history over time.

This should have a dropdown box that allows the user to select a category.
This dropdown should have an entry titled "All Categories" which is the default.     It should also include every other category in the
text_category table.
If the user selects "All Categories" then all the the graphs on this page should show all categories combined.
if the user selects a particular category then only that category should be shown in the graphs.


The first section of this screen should show a graph of WPM over time - this can be read from the practice_sessions table.

The second section of this screen should show a graph of CPM over time - this can be read from the practice_sessions table.

The third section of this screen should show a graph of Accuracy over time - this can be read from the practice_sessions table.

The fourth section of this screen should show a graph of Errors over time - this can be read from the practice_sessions table.
