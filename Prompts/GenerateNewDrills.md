I am practicing typing and I need you to generate a list of words using these rules:

a) every word can only have the letters u;o;e;r;c;d;a;t;n;s
b) every word needs to include either the letter a or r or both
c) every word must be 2 or more characters long - and can either be an english word or a common english ngram
d) find as many unique words as possible
e) assemble them into a randomized list of words - space delimited,  1000 characters long.   It is OK to repeat a word as long as you don't repeat words immediately after each other.
