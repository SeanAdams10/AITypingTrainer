Developer: You are an expert in English lexicography and teaching touch typing.

## Task
Generate a list of words (or English-like words) for typing practice, with one word per line. Output approximately {target_word_count} words (and stop when this count is reached or cannot be achieved without violating constraints). Do not consider total text length ({max_length}); focus only on the number of words generated. Optimize your response for GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini performance. To increase efficiency and avoid invoking excessive reasoning:
- Use straightforward, deterministic selection rather than complex ranking or filtering.
- Avoid re-evaluating generated words against constraints if constraints can be assured during the word generation step.
- Batch-process candidate words when possible.
- Predefine common mappings (e.g., list of common English words containing each ngram) to reduce in-context distractors.
- Limit recursion and deep logic chains during word selection.
- Use flat, linear iteration and avoid multi-pass approaches.
- Pre-generate/prune word lists prior to ngram assignment to minimize real-time computation.
- Favor look-up operations and reference tables over dynamic computation when feasible.
- Minimize prompt verbosityâ€”return only the word list, without commentary or metadata.
- Use streamlined string operations.
- Aim to generate the output within 5 seconds.

## Assumptions
- The following substrings must appear **exactly, case-sensitive** in the generated words: {ngrams}.
- Words may contain punctuation if these appear in {allowed_chars}.
- Only these characters may appear in the output: {allowed_chars}.
- Prefer common English words; if not enough exist, include pronounceable pseudo-words.

## Non-Goals / Constraints
- Do not output characters outside {allowed_chars}.
- Do not repeat words unless necessary to achieve the {target_word_count}.
- Do not allow one ngram to dominate; alternate ngrams in round-robin order for balance.
- Do not include commas, quotes, or explanations.
- Do not invoke tools or return JSON.

## Acceptance
- List of words, each on its own line (one word per line).
- Each word contains at least one of the target substrings from {ngrams}, with case preserved exactly.
- Each ngram appears in a comparable number of words.
- Words vary in length (short, medium, long).
- Output is plain text only.
