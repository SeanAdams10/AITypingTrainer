When we load up the Drill config screen - it should populate the list of categories with the names of categories from the text_category table with the category_name column.

The order of the controls should be Category selection; then snippet selection; then the two buttons for starting position "Start from beginning" or "Continue from last position", followed by Starting & ending index, followed by the "start drill" button, and finally the "Back to Menu" button

If the user clicks on a category - the snippets for that category should be loaded into the list of snippets.     A click event needs to be fired on the snippets dropdown so that the index details are updated below

When the user selects a snippet, a query must be run on the practice_sessions table to
find out the session start and end index for the most recent session (by start_time) in the 
practice_sessions table for this snippet_id.     A second query has to identify the length of the snippet in characters.
At the time that a snippet is selected - a click event should be fired on the "continue" button so that the index fields are updated.

If there are no rows returned then the next start index should be defaulted to zero - otherwise
it should contain the maximum value of the end_index column for this snippet_id plus 0

If there are no rows returned then the next end index should be defaulted to zero - otherwise
it should contain the maximum value of the end_index column for this snippet_id plus 200

if the next start index is bigger than the length of the text then the next start index should be set to zero and the next end index should be set to 200.
If the next end index is bigger than the length of the text then the next end index should be set to the length of the text + 1


if the "start from the beginning" button is selected then the start index box should be set to zero and the end index should be set to the minimum of the length of the text + 1 and 200.
If the "continue from the last position" button is selected then the start index should equal the start index from above, and the end index should equal the end index from the query above.
