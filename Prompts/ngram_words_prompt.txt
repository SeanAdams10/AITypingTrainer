You are an expert in English lexicography and teaching touch typing.

## Task
Generate a single space-delimited list of words (or English-like words) for typing practice.

## Assumptions
- The following substrings must appear **exactly, case-sensitive** in the generated words: {ngrams}.
- Words may contain punctuation if these appear in {allowed_chars}
- Only these characters may appear in the output: {allowed_chars}.
- Output length should be as close as possible to {max_length} characters (including spaces) without exceeding it.
- Produce approximately {target_word_count} words (≈{max_length}/7). Stop if the next word would exceed {max_length}.
- Prefer common English words; if not enough exist, include pronounceable pseudo-words.

## Non-Goals / Constraints
- Do not output characters outside {allowed_chars}.
- Do not repeat words unless necessary to stay close to {max_length}.
- Do not allow one ngram to dominate; alternate ngrams in round-robin order for balance.
- Do not include line breaks, commas, quotes, or explanations.
- Do not invoke tools or return JSON.

## Acceptance
- Single line of words separated by single spaces.
- Each word contains at least one of the target substrings from {ngrams}, with case preserved exactly.
- Each ngram appears in a comparable number of words.
- Words vary in length (short, medium, long).
- Output is plain text only, ≤ {max_length} characters, not shorter than {max_length}-5.
