The primary purpose of the typing drill page is to allow the user to practice 
typing a given snippet of text - and to measure and recored the performance and accuracy
of their typing.

The page receives an input of the snippet_id, the start index and the end index for the text.
This text is then displayed in the typing window.

As the user types - if the key pressed is correct then the character on screen goes green.  
If the keystroke is incorrect then the character on screen goes red and bold

The typing window keeps an internal timer which starts counting when the user types the first character.    The timer stops when the user completes the text accurately or when the user hits cancel.
During the typing - the key stats on the top of the page are updated either every second or every keystroke.   These key metrics are:
- time elapsed
- total characters typed
- errors
- accuracy
- words per minute
- characters per minute


When the typing drill is finished - the typing window should become read-only.
Then we need to  make entries into multiple tables:

1. practice_sessions
create a row in the practice_sessions table with the following columns:
- session_id: this is a new session ID for every typing drill session
session_id is the primary key for this table
- snippet_id: the ID of the snippet that was used in the drill
- snippet_index_start: the start index of the snippet that was used in the drill
- snippet_index_end: the end index of the snippet that was used in the drill
- start_time: the date and time the drill started when the user pressed the first key
- end_time: the date and time the drill ended
- total_time: the total time the drill took
- session_wpm: the words per minute of the drill
- session_cpm: the characters per minute of the drill
- expected_chars: the expected number of characters in the drill
- actual_chars: the total number of keystrokes in the drill
- errors: the number of errors in the drill
- accuracy: the accuracy of the drill

2. practice_session_keystrokes
create a row in the practice_session_keystrokes table for every keystroke with the following columns:
- session_id: the ID of the session that the keystroke was in
- keystroke_id: this is a new keystroke ID for every keystroke in the drill
the combination of session_id and keystroke_id is the primary key for this table
session_id is a foreign key to the practice_sessions table
- keystroke_time: the time the keystroke was made
- keystroke_char: the character that was typed
- expected_char: the character that was expected to be typed
- is_correct: a boolean indicating whether the keystroke was correct or not
- time_since_previous: the time since the previous keystroke in milliseconds (integer)

Note: for the first keystroke, the time_since_previous should be null
