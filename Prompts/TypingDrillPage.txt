When the typing drill is finished - the typing window should become read-only.
Then we need to  make entries into multiple tables:

1. practice_sessions
create a row in the practice_sessions table with the following columns:
- session_id: this is a new session ID for every typing drill session
session_id is the primary key for this table
- snippet_id: the ID of the snippet that was used in the drill
- snippet_index_start: the start index of the snippet that was used in the drill
- snippet_index_end: the end index of the snippet that was used in the drill
- start_time: the date and time the drill started
- end_time: the date and time the drill ended
- total_time: the total time the drill took
- session_wpm: the words per minute of the drill
- session_cpm: the characters per minute of the drill
- expected_chars: the expected number of characters in the drill
- actual_chars: the total number of keystrokes in the drill
- errors: the number of errors in the drill
- accuracy: the accuracy of the drill

2. practice_session_keystrokes
create a row in the practice_session_keystrokes table for every keystroke with the following columns:
- session_id: the ID of the session that the keystroke was in
- keystroke_id: this is a new keystroke ID for every keystroke in the drill
the combination of session_id and keystroke_id is the primary key for this table
session_id is a foreign key to the practice_sessions table
- keystroke_time: the time the keystroke was made
- keystroke_char: the character that was typed
- expected_char: the character that was expected to be typed
- is_correct: a boolean indicating whether the keystroke was correct or not
- time_since_previous: the time since the previous keystroke in milliseconds (integer)

Note: for the first keystroke, the time_since_previous should be null

3. practice_session_errors
create a row in the practice_session_errors table for every error with the following columns:
- session_id: the ID of the session that the error was in
- error_id: this is a new error ID for every error in the drill
the combination of session_id and error_id is the primary key for this table
session_id is a foreign key to the practice_sessions table
- error_time: the time the error was made
- error_char: the character that was typed
- expected_char: the character that was expected to be typed

4. practice_session_bigram
create a row in the practice_session_bigram table for every bigram (consecutive pairs of characters) with the following columns:
- session_id: the ID of the session that the bigram was in
- bigram_id: this is a new bigram ID for every bigram in the drill
the combination of session_id and bigram_id is the primary key for this table
session_id is a foreign key to the practice_sessions table
- bigram_time: the number of milliseconds to type this bigram
- bigram_text: the bigram that was typed
- expected_bigram: the bigram that was expected to be typed
- is_correct: a boolean indicating whether the bigram was correct or not

5. practice_session_trigram
create a row in the practice_session_trigram table for every trigram (consecutive triplets of characters) with the following columns:
- session_id: the ID of the session that the trigram was in
- trigram_id: this is a new trigram ID for every trigram in the drill
the combination of session_id and trigram_id is the primary key for this table
session_id is a foreign key to the practice_sessions table

- trigram_time: the number of milliseconds to type this trigram
- trigram_text: the trigram that was typed
- expected_trigram: the trigram that was expected to be typed
- is_correct: a boolean indicating whether the trigram was correct or not

6. practice_session_word
create a row in the practice_session_word table for every word in the typing text with the following columns:
- session_id: the ID of the session 
- word_id: this is a new word ID for every word in the drill
the combination of session_id and word_id is the primary key for this table
session_id is a foreign key to the practice_sessions table
- word_time: the number of milliseconds to type this word
- word_text: the word that was typed
- expected_word: the word that was expected to be typed
- is_correct: a boolean indicating whether the word was correct or not

If the user hits the finish button - it should return the user to the main menu page
