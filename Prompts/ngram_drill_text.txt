{allowed_chars} = [u,e,o,t,s,n,c,d,a,r,i,l,m,h,y,p,b,g,f,w,v,k]


- Generate {1000} words that are pronounceable or look like plausible English or pseudo-English.     Strong bias for real English words, with a bias for the most commonly used words, and also rare words from the top 100 000 english words
- Each word must vary in length. Include:
  - Short (2–4 letters)
  - Medium (5–7 letters) 
  - Long (8+ letters) 
- Each word must use only the following characters: `{allowed_chars}`


## PHASE 2: Character Validation

For each candidate word, check every character:

**Keep only the words made up entirely of these characters - this list is case sensitive:**
`{allowed_chars}`

> ❌ Reject the word if it contains any other character — even one letter outside this set.  
> ✅ Keep the word if it only uses allowed characters.
> ❌ Reject the word if it contains any character repeated 3 times in a row

Please aim for 40% of the words between 2-4 letters
- 40% of the words between 5 and 7 letters
- 20% of the words 7+ letters long

Please make sure that 80% of the words either have the character v or the character k included. 
Please make sure that at least 50% of the words are genuine english


## Phase 3:
You want to randomize the order of the words so that you don't have repeats directly after each other.
Do not allow the same words to repeat in patterns of 2 or 3.    If the same pairs of words repeat immediately - reject these
if the same word triplets repeat immediately - reject these
If the same 4 words repeat immediately - reject these
If the same 5 words repeat immediately - reject these
If the same 6 words repeat immediately - reject these







 ## FINAL OUTPUT

- Output only valid words, space-separated, on a single line.
- No punctuation, no numbers, no line breaks to mark each word
- Do not include explanations or commentary.
- Aim for 5000 characters
