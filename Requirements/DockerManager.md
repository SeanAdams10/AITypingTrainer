1. Main Objective
- Purpose: Provide a deterministic way for automated tests and tooling to provision, manage, and dispose of a disposable PostgreSQL instance that runs inside Docker.
- Scope: Covers container lifecycle management (start, wait, stop, remove), temporary database provisioning, connection metadata exposure, configurable image selection via startup configuration, image availability enforcement, and automated cleanup via context management. Excludes higher-level schema creation, data seeding, or Docker engine installation.

2. User Stories & Use Cases
- As a backend engineer, I need a repeatable method to spin up a PostgreSQL test instance so integration tests can run against a clean datastore.
- As a QA automation script, I need to ensure any prior PostgreSQL container with the same name is removed before tests start to avoid state leakage.
- As a test harness, I want to create and drop temporary databases on demand so parallel test cases do not interfere with each other.
- Personas (optional): Backend engineer maintaining CI pipelines, QA automation developer, local developer running integration tests.

3. Functional Requirements
- Features:
  - The module shall provide a function to start a Docker container that runs PostgreSQL, always removing any stale container with the same name first.
  - The module shall expose connection parameters (host, port, user, password, database) for the active container to downstream callers.
  - The module shall wait until PostgreSQL accepts TCP connections before marking the container ready.
  - The module shall offer operations to stop and remove the managed container.
  - The module shall support creating uniquely named temporary databases and removing them after use.
  - The module shall support use as a context manager so the container is removed when the context exits or the object is garbage collected.
  - The module shall read a configuration file on initialization to determine the PostgreSQL Docker image tag, defaulting to `postgres:16.10-alpine3.22` when no override is provided.
  - The module shall expose a helper method that ensures the configured Docker image exists locally, pulling the image when Docker reports it is missing.
- Inputs/Outputs:
  - Inputs include container name, PostgreSQL credentials, database name, host port, and optional temporary database name for removal.
  - Configuration input includes an image tag string stored in the configuration file under the key `postgres_image`.
  - Outputs include a dictionary of connection parameters and string identifiers for created temporary databases.
- Business Logic:
  - Before starting, the system must query Docker for an existing container matching the requested name and forcibly remove it to avoid conflicts.
  - At initialization, the system must load the configuration file (default path `config/docker_manager.json`), gracefully handling missing files or keys, to resolve the effective image tag.
  - Before starting, the system must verify the resolved PostgreSQL Docker image exists locally, invoking the helper method to pull it when absent.
  - When starting, the system must run a PostgreSQL Docker image with the requested environment variables and port mapping, detached from the current process.
  - After start, the system must poll PostgreSQL connectivity up to a fixed attempt count, sleeping between attempts, and raise an error if readiness is not achieved.
  - Temporary databases must be named with a GUID-derived suffix to guarantee uniqueness, and creation or removal must be executed via SQL commands against the default postgres database.
  - On cleanup (explicit, context exit, or destruction) the system must attempt to terminate and remove the container to prevent orphaned resources.
- Pseudocode (optional):
  - start_container(): remove_existing(); resolve_image_tag(); ensure_image(image_tag); run_postgres_image(image_tag); wait_for_ready(); cache_connection_params(); return params.
  - add_tmp_db(): clone_connection_params(); switch database to postgres; execute CREATE DATABASE with unique name; return name.
  - remove_tmp_db(name): terminate active connections; execute DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS name.
  - ensure_image(image_tag): query Docker for image; if missing then pull image; return metadata.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Container startup polling shall complete within approximately 5 attempts with a 2 second interval; readiness checks must time out cleanly if exceeded.
- Security: Credentials handled are test-only; module must not log passwords beyond standard configuration prints.
- Reliability: Failures in stop/remove operations shall be surfaced while allowing further cleanup; readiness polling must detect and report PostgreSQL startup failures.
- Portability: Module assumes Docker engine availability on the host and should remain agnostic of operating system specifics aside from Docker dependencies.
- Configurability: Configuration parsing must tolerate absent files by substituting the default `postgres:16.10-alpine3.22` image tag without preventing startup.

5. Data Model & Design
- UML Diagrams: Not required; the design consists of a single manager component responsible for container orchestration.
- Entity-Relationship Model: Not applicable; the manager does not define persistent entities.
- Data Tables: Not applicable; only temporary PostgreSQL databases are created on demand.
- Configuration Schema: JSON document located at `config/docker_manager.json` with an optional `postgres_image` string property that overrides the default Docker image tag.

6. Acceptance Criteria
- Starting the manager with default parameters yields a running PostgreSQL container reachable on localhost with the specified credentials.
- Attempting to start when a container with the same name already exists results in the old container being removed and a new one launched.
- Readiness polling stops after PostgreSQL accepts connections and raises an error if the database never becomes ready within the configured attempts.
- Calling add_tmp_db returns a unique database name and the database exists in PostgreSQL until removed.
- Calling remove_tmp_db on an existing temporary database drops the database even if active connections exist.
- Using the manager in a with-statement ensures the container is removed when the block exits.
- When the configuration file is absent, the manager defaults to `postgres:16.10-alpine3.22` and successfully starts the container.
- When a configuration file specifies a custom image tag, the helper method pulls the image if missing and startup uses that image.
- Invoking the image helper against an already available image completes without pulling again and without raising errors.

7. User Interface & Experience (if applicable)
- Not applicable; the module exposes only programmatic interfaces and console logs for observability.

8. Integration & Interoperability
- External Systems: Requires Docker Engine API access and a PostgreSQL Docker image (default `postgres:16.10-alpine3.22`) available to pull/run.
- Data Exchange: Interaction occurs through Docker APIs and PostgreSQL network protocols; no additional data formats are used.
- Configuration: Reads local JSON configuration from `config/docker_manager.json` (or a caller-specified override) to resolve the image tag.

9. Constraints & Assumptions
- Technical Constraints: Host must have Docker installed, network access to fetch Docker images, the default `postgres:16.10-alpine3.22` image accessible, and the requested port available.
- Assumptions: Callers provide valid credentials, have network access to localhost, properly handle raised exceptions during startup or cleanup, and supply valid JSON when overriding the configuration file.
