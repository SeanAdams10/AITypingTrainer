When I try to "generate practice content" on the screen @dynamic_config.py - I get this error

Task: Please fix this error by passing the accepted characters into the ngram service from the dynamic config form
Deliverable: Updated code which keeps the existing functionality described in @DynamicConfig.md but fixes the defect above
Assumptions: this should be a relatively small change
- Please also fix any mypy or ruff issues identified in any of the files you touch iteratively until there are none left
- All variables need to be type checked
- Functions should follow Martin Fowler's "Single Responsiblity" principle - if not, please refactor gradually to fix this using the extract function pattern.    
- Test cases must be updated to comprensively test any functionality added or changed.    Do not adjust test cases only to fix failing tests - test cases must achieve the outcome in the .md file.     Any new tests should make use of common test fixtures, and should be parameterized tests where possible.
- Requirement files (.md specifications) should contain the most up to date requirements for functionality, in a structured fashion, along with the 
Non Goals: 
- Do not change other areas of the code unless you get explicit confirmtaion from me
Acceptance:
- No ruff or Mypy issues
- Defect identified is resolved
- Test case coverage is at 90%+ without committing demeter violations (create test affordances if needed)
