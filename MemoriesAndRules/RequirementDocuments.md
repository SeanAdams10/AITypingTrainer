# Requirement Document Standards

This document defines the standards for writing requirement documents for new features, modules, or systems. These standards are synthesized from existing requirements documents and are intended to ensure clarity, completeness, and implementability across desktop, cloud, and web platforms. The requirements should be language-agnostic and focus on user needs.

---

## 1. Main Objective
- **Purpose:** Clearly state the primary goal or problem the feature/module/system is intended to solve.
- **Scope:** Define the boundaries of the requirement (what is included and what is not).

## 2. User Stories & Use Cases
- **User Needs:** Describe the needs, motivations, and goals of the end users.
- **Use Cases:** List typical scenarios of usage, including actors and expected outcomes.
- **Personas (optional):** Briefly describe representative user types.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- **Features:** Enumerate all required features and functions.
- **Inputs/Outputs:** Specify expected inputs and outputs for each function.
- **Business Logic:** Detail the rules, calculations, and decision-making processes.
- **Pseudocode (optional):** Use pseudocode to clarify complex logic, keeping it language-independent.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Specify speed, responsiveness, and scalability expectations.
- **Security:** Outline security, privacy, and data protection needs.
- **Reliability:** Define uptime, error handling, and recovery requirements.
- **Portability:** Ensure requirements are not tied to desktop, cloud, or web; specify any platform-specific considerations.

## 5. Data Model & Design
- **UML Diagrams:** Include class diagrams, sequence diagrams, or other relevant UML representations.
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model:** Provide ER diagrams for database design, if applicable.
- **Data Tables:** List key tables, fields, and relationships.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- **Testable Outcomes:** Define clear, measurable criteria for acceptance.
- **Edge Cases:** List important edge cases and how they should be handled.
- **Validation:** Specify how requirements will be verified (manual, automated, etc.).

## 7. User Interface & Experience (if applicable)
- **UI Mockups:** Provide wireframes or mockups for key screens.
- **UX Considerations:** Describe navigation, accessibility, and usability requirements.

## 8. Integration & Interoperability
- **External Systems:** List any required integrations (APIs, services, databases).
- **Data Exchange:** Specify formats and protocols for data interchange.

## 9. Constraints & Assumptions
- **Technical Constraints:** Note any limitations (hardware, software, network, etc.).
- **Assumptions:** List assumptions made during requirements gathering.

## 10. Glossary & References
- **Glossary:** Define key terms and acronyms.
- **References:** Link to related documents, standards, or external resources.

**Note:**
- Requirements should be implementation-agnostic and not prescribe a specific technology stack.
- Diagrams and pseudocode should be used to clarify intent, not to dictate design.
- The document should be updated as requirements evolve.
